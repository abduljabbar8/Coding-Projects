    <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
    <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>Mental illnesses, and the stigma surrounding them, are challenges we must face together. Many communities struggle with the stigma of mental health diagnoses and treatment. While people will openly seek treatment for a broken arm or heart disease, their decision to seek treatment for a mental health illness is often kept secret and many times, avoided entirely due to stigma. With this website, we hope to increase awareness, decrease stigma and connect those who need them with resources to help.</p>
